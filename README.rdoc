This is the capstone project of @catstavi and @lilyfromseattle. The Ada Capstone project represents one month of work to build a full project from scratch.

This is a single page rails app that relies on AJAX to create a smooth user experience.
The app makes API calls to Instagram, Yelp, Google Places, Google Maps, and a keyword extractor service.
